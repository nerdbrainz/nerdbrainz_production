              What is an E-COMMERCE website?
            </h1>
            <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-custom-color-ten">
              E-commerce is the act of buying and selling goods and services
              online.
              <br />
              There are many ways to trade on the internet but for the sake of
              this explanation we will narrow that field down to the advertising
              of a product or service and the exchange of money for that product
              or service completely online.
              <br />
              An e-commerce site will normally have all the standard pages that
              a Static Website has with the addition of product and marketing
              pages, a shopping basket page and pages designed for the exchange
              of customer information and of course money. Where an e-commerce
              site really differs is the Back End.
              <br />
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-custom-color-ten">
              The back end is what really separates the static website from an
              e-commerce selling platform. True many static sites have backends
              especially those with blogs or booking systems built in. But an
              E-commerce platform is a far more complicated endeavor.
              <br />
              The e-commerce back end must have the ability for the vendor to
              easily upload their products, be able to keep inventories and
              stock checks and of course be able to collect the customers
              essential information and payment. At the same time it must be
              able to do all this securely.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-custom-color-ten">
              Now this is a massive simplification of the process but we can see
              just by looking at this, the magnitude of the process. We can
              start to see why the price difference between a static site and an
              e-commerce site is such a jump.
              <br />
              For a website developer to build a system like this normally takes
              many months of engineering and testing and would continue to need
              full time monitoring and updating.

              Luckily for us there are a number of very good CMS Content
              Management System systems on the market. A good CMS will handle
              all these essential elements for you and can be built into your
              custom E-commerce website.
              <br />
              <br />
              What you get from the right CMS is a secure and robust backend
              system that will allow you to manipulate elements of your website,
              update product and services information. With the addition of a
              CRM Customer Relationship Management that is often included in the
              CMS you can collect details about what customers are using your
              site and how they are interacting with it, and of course gains the
              ability to securely receive payments. CMS services are normally a
              small additional cost per month that is often incorporated into
              your hosting fees. The benefits of essentially renting this
              technology is that the CMS providers are constantly improving and
              updating their technologies and you are provided with the fastest
              and safest version of the software.
              <br />
              <br />
              Once you have chosen the customer design often called a wire-frame
              and agree with your software engineers what kind of backend would
              be best suited for your needs it is up to the software developers
              to integrate your custom designs with the backend of choice. This
              normally requires an engineer or team of engineers adept at
              several coding languages to seamlessly integrate both elements.
              Creating a consistent experience for you as the operator and your
              customers alike.
              <br />
              <br />
              To summarize an E-commerce site is what you need if you are going
              to sell your products and services online. Choosing a custom site,
              as well as offering something totally unique you will end up with
              the website that is really best suited to your individual needs.
              Deciding on the right developers will make this process so much
              easier for you as they can work with you and get to know your
              business and learn where you see that business going in the future
              and they in turn can build a site set to evolve with your company,
              new technologies and the marketplace.
