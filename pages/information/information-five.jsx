              What Website Is Right For Me?
            </h1>
            <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-custom-color-ten">
              With so much on the market when it comes to choosing a website, is
              it easy to get lost in all the facts and figures. So letâ€™s make
              this simple.
              <br />
              A websites purpose is to present something that you want to
              showcase. At one end of that spectrum you have information that
              you want to share with the world. That could be a portfolio of
              work, a blog or important points relating to your business,
              something like contact details, open times, menu and so on. On the
              other end of the spectrum you can have a large multi levelled
              website with user logins, the transfer of money and the storage of
              sensitive information.
              <br />
              Despite the seemingly overwhelming depth of the subject there are
              some common questions that anyone commissioning a website should
              ask themselves.

            <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-custom-color-ten">

              2. Do I want my website to be a purely informational resource. Or
              do I want to sell my services or products as well.
              <br />
              3. Do I have the skills or desire to take complete control over
              the website or would I prefer someone else to build and/or manage
              and make future changes to the site for me.
              <br />
              4. Who is the audience that I am trying to target.
              <br />
              5. What is my budget and how big an investment will a website be.
              <br />
              6. What is unique about my business
              <br />
              7. What pages do I need to best convey what I need to showcase

              quickly, it can come with unforeseen limitations down the road and
              can often be difficult to expand as your business grows. Engaging

              Hiring a professional web developer is a great option as they will
              help you map out your desires and expectations for the website and
              your online business model. Often just talking to the right
              website developer or agency you will come away with a clearer
              picture of what you need in a website and the steps you need to
              take to realise that goal. The biggest bonus of choosing a
              developer is that they are normally well versed in several
              programming languages. So therefore can confidently build a
              website with fewer limitations.
