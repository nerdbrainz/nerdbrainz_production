        desc="Static websites are marketing and landing pages that allow businesses and people to get their message online for the rest of the world to see. When building a static site a company is often looking to either put up a simple web presence or to save money and still be able to be a part of the online community. Static sites can have blogs and features of other websites but are often smaller starter websites or where a company just needs a simple web presence to display a product or face of a business."

            So What Is A Static Website?
          </h1>
          <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-custom-color-ten">
            A static site is the perfect option for businesses wanting to convey
            information but not necessarily use their site heavily for sales or
            high customer interaction. A good example of an optimum static
            website user would be a boutique hotel, restaurant or hairdressing
            service. Businesses like these need to be able to show the potential
            customers what their business represents and the clientele that it
            is best suited for. The essential information is often limited to
            opening times, a list of services, price list or a menu and a way of
            contacting or finding that business. A booking service is often a
            popular addition to this kind of website.
            <br />
            Static sites are also preferred by organisations such as legal,
            financial, management services. Organisations where the main purpose
            of the site is to tell the customer what they can expect from their
            services and how to get in contact.
            <br />
            <br />A static site normally consists of, but not limited to a
            Landing Page, an About Us Page and a Contact Page.

            Landing Page{" "}
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-custom-color-ten">
            The Landing page is the first page that should load on a static
            website. It is good to think of the Landing Page as your shopfront,
            as it represents your company. Customers will interoperate what you
            stand for in the first few seconds they visit you at your site. A
            well designed and built custom site will help with this. As modern
            internet users really understand and appreciate quality.

            An About Page{" "}
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-custom-color-ten">
            The about page is self explanatory, but it is a chance to
            communicate in greater depth your vision for your company and where
            you feel it belongs in the world. The about page is also a great
            opportunity for you to share your credentials and experience with
            potential clients and should be viewed as a further way to win
            potential customers over.

            The Contact Page
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-custom-color-ten">
            The contact page is there to tell customers how to get in touch with
            you. If you are at a geographical location it should have your
            address and often a google map view and link to make it easier for
            the customer to find you. Opening times, telephone and email
            information are all standard.
            <br />
            For many the contact page is a great opportunity to develop a
            stronger relationship with your potential clients. With an
            integrated marketing automation platform you can collect client
            email addresses in a database. So in the future you can create an
            organic marketing system, reaching out to people you know are
            interested in your service directly.

            Further Information Pages
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-custom-color-ten">
            This is an opportunity for a more in-depth look at what your company
            aspires to and what it represents. Further pages are often used to
            show examples of your work, share case studies and testimonials from
            happy customers. These pages help your business by really showing
            the world your full capabilities, but equally importantly and often
            overlooked or misunderstood is SEO. SEO or search engine
            optimization simply put is your ranking on a search engine like
            google. Essentially how close to the top of a search will your
            website land. Of course you can pay the likes of google to be higher
            up on their search engines. However a well written website with the
            write key words will strongly increase your visibility and
            likelihood that your site will rank higher.
            <br />
            <br />
            To sum up, your business is unique and your love and belief in your
            product must be conveyed to the consumer for your business to
            realise its potential. br A prebuilt template may well be able to do
            this but all restrictions will come at a cost. For the growing
            business that cost is often greater that the the added expense of a
            totally unique custom website built just for you.

            The Blog
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-custom-color-ten">
            A blog is a great opportunity to reach more people and boost your
            aforementioned search engine optimisation. A good blog from a
            service or product provider is an amazing tool to educate those
            individuals interested but undecided about what they want, or what
            their exact needs actually are. At the same time converting those
            readers into customers. Blogs are now commonplace with many services
            offering pre-written or professionally written custom blogs for
            those that donâ€™t have the time or inclination to write their own.
