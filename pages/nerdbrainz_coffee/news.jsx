                      @ Nerd Brainz we deal in quality and customer happiness.
                      Our number one goal is to make great money doing what we
                      love. But there is only one way we get there, and that is
                      treating every customer like they mean something to us.
                      Because they do. We do not just want to build web sites
                      and never talk to the customer again.
                    </p>
                    <p className="leading-relaxed text-xl">
                      We want to bring success into our customers lives and help
                      them fix business intelligence mistakes and compound on
                      the things that they are already doing right. We want to
                      bring E-commerce solutions and business intelligence to
                      every one so that they can make the most of the resources
                      they have and we can all retire early.{" "}
